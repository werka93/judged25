# Judged – Legal Help UI (Florida Arrest & Bail Guide)

Judged is a mobile-first web application that guides users through the legal process in Florida, starting from the moment a loved one is arrested. This project provides clear, step-by-step UI to help families understand what to do next—from arrest and bail to legal representation and trial preparation.
